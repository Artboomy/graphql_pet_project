# Graphql pet project

## Description

The goal of this project is to get some practice with various frameworks.

Project consists of simple web application.

GUI is written in React + MaterialUI.

Server-side rendering provided by Next.js.

3rd party Graphql API is used for data.

## 3rd party API

[AniList API](https://anilist.gitbook.io/anilist-apiv2-docs/overview/overview)

## Done

✅ Server-side render for anime pages - SSR & Next.js practice

✅ Main page with search - React & GraphQL & Apollo practice

✅ Pre-commit hooks - Husky & ESLint & Stylelint practice

## To do

## Caveats

This is test repo, so it is expected to contain some rough corners.

Since jest uses babel config, but I don't want this config to be used by next.js - test command manually copies the file,
and removes afterwards on success. Commands should be run from bash.
